# Algorithm Efficiency Analyzer

This Python project provides a comprehensive analysis of various sorting algorithms and allows users to compare their performance with ease. The project is focused on sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Radix Sort.

## Features

- Analyze the time complexity of different sorting algorithms.
- Compare algorithm performance across different input sizes.
- Run custom sorting with a choice of algorithm.
- Visualize the performance of sorting algorithms with matplotlib graphs.
- Understand the efficiency and suitability of sorting algorithms for specific tasks.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script to compare algorithm performance or perform custom sorting.

```bash
python main.py
